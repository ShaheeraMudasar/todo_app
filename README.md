# To-Do App

This is a To-Do application built with Python and Flask.

## Important Files

- **`test_tasks.json`**: This file is used for testing purposes. During testing, the contents of `test_tasks.json` are copied into `tasks.json` to provide a predefined set of tasks, which the unit tests rely on.
- **Postman Collection**: A Postman collection (`postman_collection.json`) is included for easy testing of the API endpoints.
